This is the script I personally use to give transparency to PNGs.</br>
Since it's for personal use, theres no UI, and ajustments to configurations come from altering the value of variables in the script itself. I tried declaring these variables on the top of the file for easy acess.</br>
In the updated files they are more organized, but this version is 100% functional. Pillow was the library that made it possible.</br>
<strong>How to use</strong>: Put the image to have the green removed in the folder "images", and a version without the green of each will be created in the folder "output", with the same name, once the script is ran.</br>
<strong>Note</strong>: Obviously, the scrip tracks file paths, so make sure they are local (in the same folder).</br>
